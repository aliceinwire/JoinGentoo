Why Gentoo works
---------

- Easy to contribute
- Good Support
- You can prioritize in coding and enjoing it!
- Made by developers for developers
- "teach a man how to fish" philosophy
- flexibility  
You can control which features of a given package are enabled and consequently how many dependencies get pulled in.  
- Stable  
Also if most of the package is more updated than in other binary distribution is same good in stability!
